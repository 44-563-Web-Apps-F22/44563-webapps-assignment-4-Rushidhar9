    <h5>PRINCESS IDA</h5>
    <h7>ACT II
        SCENE Gardens in Castle Adamant. A river runs across the
        back of the stage, crossed by a rustic bridge. Castle
        Adamant in the distance.</h7>
    <p>
        Chorus: Merrily ring the luncheon bell, the luncheon
        bell!

        Princess: You say you know the court of Hildebrand?
        There is a Prince there — I forget his name —

        Hilarion: Hilarion?

        Princess: Exactly — is he well?

        Hilarion: If it be well to droop and pine and mope,
        To sigh "Oh, Ida! Ida!" all day long,
        "Ida! my love! my life! Oh, come to me!"
        If it be well, I say, to do all this,
        Then Prince Hilarion is very well.

        Princess: He breathes our name? Well, it's a common one!
        And is the booby comely?

        Hilarion: Pretty well.
        I've heard it said that if I dressed myself
        In Prince Hilarion's clothes (supposing this
        Consisted with my maiden modesty),
        I might be taken for Hilarion's self.
        But what is this to you or me, who think
        Of all mankind with undisguised contempt?

        Princess: Contempt? Why, damsel, when I think of man,
        Contempt is not the word.

        Cyril: (Getting tipsy) I'm sure of that,
        Or if it is, it surely should not be!

        Hilarion: (Aside to Cyril) Be quiet, idiot, or they'll find us
        out.

        Cyril: The Prince Hilarion's a goodly lad!

        Princess: You know him then?

        Cyril: (Tipsily) I rather think I do!
        We are inseparables!

        Princess: Why, what's this?
        You love him then?

        Cyril: We do indeed — all
        three!

        Hilarion: Madam, she jests! (Aside to Cyril) Remember where
        you
        are!

        Cyril: Jests? Not at all! Why, bless my heart alive,
        You and Hilarion, when at the Court,
        Rode the same horse!

        Princess: (Horrified) Astride?

        Cyril: Of course! Why not?
        Wore the same clothes — and once or twice, I think,
        Got tipsy in the same good company!

        Princess: Well, these are nice young ladies, on my word!

        Cyril: (Tipsy) Don't you remember that old kissing-song
        He'd sing to blushing Mistress Lalage,
        The hostess of the Pigeons? Thus it ran:

        SONG (Cyril)
        "Would you know the Kind of Maid"

        (During symphony Hilarion and
        Florian try to
        stop Cyril. He shakes them
        off angrily.)

        Cyril: Would you know the kind of maid
        Sets my heart aflame-a?
        Eyes must be downcast and staid,
        Cheeks must flush for shame-a!
        She may neither dance nor sing,
        But, demure in everything,
        Hang her head in modest way,
        With pouting lips, with pouting lips
        that
        seem to say,
        "Oh kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me,
        Though I die of shame-a!"
        Please you, that's the kind of maid
        Sets my heart aflame-a!
        "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me,
        Though I die of shame-a!"
        Please you, that's the kind of maid
        Sets my heart aflame-a!

        When a maid is bold and gay,
        With a tongue goes clang-a,
        Flaunting it in brave array,
        Maiden may go hang-a
        Sunflow'r gay and holly-hock
        Never shall my garden stock;
        Mine the blushing rose of May,
        With pouting lips, with pouting lips
        that
        seem to say,
        "Oh kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me,
        Though I die for shame-a!"
        Please you, that's the kind of maid
        Sets my heart aflame-a!
        "Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me,
        Though I die of shame-a!"
        Please you, that's the kind of maid
        Sets my heart aflame-a!

        Princess: Infamous creature, get you hence away!

        (Hilarion, Who has been with difficulty
        restrained by
        Florian during this song, breaks from him
        and strikes
        Cyril furiously on
        the breast.)

        Hilarion: Dog! There is something more to sing about!
