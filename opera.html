    <h7>ACT II

        <p class="Chorus"> Merrily ring the luncheon bell, the luncheon
        bell!</p>

        <h6 class="Princess">Princess:</h6> <p class="Chorus">You say you know the court of Hildebrand?
        There is a Prince there — I forget his name —</p>

        <h6 class="Hilarion">Hilarion:</h6> <p class="Speech">Hilarion?</p>

        <h6 class="Princess">Princess:</h6> <p class="Speech">Exactly — is he well?</p>

        <h6 class="Hilarion">Hilarion:</h6> </p class="Song"> it be well to droop and pine and mope,
        To sigh "Oh, Ida! Ida!" all day long,
        "Ida! my love! my life! Oh, come to me!"
        If it be well, I say, to do all this,
        Then Prince Hilarion is very well.</p>

        <h6 class="Princess">Princess:</h6> <p class="Speech">He breathes our name? Well, it's a common one!
        And is the booby comely?</p>

        <h6 class="Hilarion">Hilarion:</h6> <p class="Speech">Pretty well.
        I've heard it said that if I dressed myself
        In Prince Hilarion's clothes </p><p class="Directions">(supposing this
        Consisted with my maiden modesty),</p>
        <p class="Speech">I might be taken for Hilarion's self.
        But what is this to you or me, who think
        Of all mankind with undisguised contempt?</p>

        <h6 class="Princess">Princess:</h6><p class="Speech"> Contempt? Why, damsel, when I think of man,
        Contempt is not the word.</p>

        <h6 class="Cyril"> Cyril: </h6> <p class="Directions">(Getting tipsy)</p><p class="Speech"> I'm sure of that,
        Or if it is, it surely should not be!</p>

        <h6 class="Hilarion">Hilarion:</h6> <p class="Directions">(Aside to Cyril)</p> <p class="Speech">Be quiet, idiot, or they'll find us
        out.</p>

        <h6 class="Cyril"> Cyril: </h6> <p class="Speech">The Prince Hilarion's a goodly lad!</p>

        <h6 class="Princess">Princess:</h6> <p class="Speech">You know him then?</p>

        <h6 class="Cyril">Cyril:</h6><p class="Directions"> (Tipsily)</p><p class="Speech"> I rather think I do!
        We are inseparables!</p>

        <h6 class="Princess">Princess:</h6><p class="Speech"><p class="Speech"> Why, what's this?
        You love him then?</p>
